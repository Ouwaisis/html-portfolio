<h1>The Best Movies According to Ouwais</h1>

    <h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>

        <h3>I Saw The Devil</h3>
            <p>It's a brilliant action thriller movie made in korea. The acting is perfect and I love how gritty and real it feals. 
                The fact it shows that revenge is just a temperory bliss, is what made it my favourite movie.

        <h3>Tare Zameen Par</h3>
            <p>A ground breaking bollywood movie. It changed the way dyslexia was viewed and treated in India.
            I loved how the movie portrayed a child being depressed and how they interacted with others because of it.</p>

        <h3>A Silent voice</h3>
            <p>A beautiful anime movie depecting redemption of a bully trying to accept what he's done 
                and helping the builled victim heal as well</p>
